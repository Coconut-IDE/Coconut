This inspection is to help you conform to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/training/articles/user-data-ids.html">"Best Practices for Unique Identifiers"</a> from the Android official documentation.

 <br>
 <br>

Using unique identifiers (UID) inappropriately <a href="TODO">may be invasive to user's privacy.</a>

 <br>
 <br>

Each unique identifier has three characteristics: scope, resettability, and uniqueness and you should choose the identifier with the characteristics that conform to your purpose. We will make suggestions for the proper UID to use based on the purpose you provide.
